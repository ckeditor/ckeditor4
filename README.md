## ⚠️ CKEditor 4: End of Life and Extended Support Model until Dec 2026

CKEditor 4 was launched in 2012 and reached its End of Life (EOL) on June 30, 2023.

A special edition, **[CKEditor 4 LTS](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-4-support/)** ("Long Term Support"), is available under commercial terms (["Extended Support Model"](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-4-support/)) for anyone looking to **extend the coverage of security updates and critical bug fixes**.

With CKEditor 4 LTS, security updates and critical bug fixes are guaranteed until December 2026.

### Important update for CKEditor 4 Users

Starting July 1, 2024, on the first anniversary of the end of life of CKEditor 4, we will activate security notifications for CKEditor 4. This change will impact the open-source version 4.22 and all earlier versions served via our CDN. Read more about the planned changes in a [dedicated article](https://ckeditor.com/blog/important-update-for-ckeditor-4-users/).

## About this repository

### Master branch = CKEditor 4 LTS

After June 30, 2023 the `master` version of the [LICENSE.md](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/blob/master/LICENSE.md) file changed to reflect the license of CKEditor 4 LTS available under the Extended Support Model.

This repository now contains the source code of CKEditor 4 LTS that is protected by copyright law.

### Getting CKEditor 4 (Open Source)

You may continue using CKEditor 4.22.1 and below under the open source license terms. Please note, however, that the open source version no longer comes with any security updates, so your application will be at risk.

In order to download the open source version of CKEditor 4, use ****tags 4.22.1 and below****. CKEditor 4.22.1 was the last version of CKEditor 4 available under the open source license terms.

CKEditor 5 is a great new editor with [lots of exciting features](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/index.html).

Before upgrading, please be aware of the following changes:

- CKEditor 5 is a completely new editor. **Upgrading is not as simple as replacing the folder with "ckeditor"** - read more in the [Migration from CKEditor 4](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/updating/ckeditor4/migration-from-ckeditor-4.html) guide.
- CKEditor 5 is available only under the GPL copyleft license (or under a commercial license).
- Open source projects with a GPL-incompatible license may apply for a license under the [Free for Open Source](https://ckeditor.com/wysiwyg-editor-open-source/) program.

### Using an outdated, unsupported version

You may continue using CKEditor 4.22.1 (or below). The license terms of the older CKEditor 4 versions have not changed. However, please note that by using software that is no longer maintained, you are introducing a **security risk to your application**.

### Signing an "Extended Support Model" contract

## Working with the `ckeditor4` repository

**Attention**: The code in this repository should be used locally and for development purposes only. We do not recommend using it in a production environment because the user experience will be very limited.

### Code installation

There is no special installation procedure to install the development code.
Simply clone it to any local directory and you are set.

### Available branches

This repository contains the following branches:

  - **`master`** &ndash; Development of the upcoming minor release.
  - **`stable`** &ndash; Latest stable release tag point (non-beta).
  - **`latest`** &ndash; Latest release tag point (including betas).
  - **`release/A.B.x`** (e.g. `4.0.x`, `4.1.x`) &ndash; Release freeze, tests, and tagging. Hotfixing.

Note that the `master` branch is under heavy development. Its code did not pass the release testing phase, though, so it may be unstable.

Additionally, all releases have their respective tags in the following form: `4.4.0`, `4.4.1`, etc. LTS editions have `-lts` at the end: `4.23.0-lts`, etc.

### Samples

The `samples/` folder contains some examples that you can use to test your installation. Visit [CKEditor 4 Examples](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/examples/index.html) for plenty of samples showcasing numerous editor features, with source code readily available to view, copy, and use in your own solution.

### Code structure

The development code contains the following main elements:

  - Main coding folders:
    - `core/` &ndash; The core API of CKEditor 4. Alone, it does nothing, but it provides the entire JavaScript API that makes the magic happen.
    - `plugins/` &ndash; Contains most of the plugins maintained by the CKEditor 4 core team.
    - `skin/` &ndash; Contains the official default skin of CKEditor 4.
    - `dev/` &ndash; Contains some developer tools.
    - `tests/` &ndash; Contains the CKEditor 4 tests suite.

### Building a release

You can create a release-optimized version of the development code locally. Use the `dev/builder/build.sh` script for that purpose:

	> ./dev/builder/build.sh

A "release-ready" working copy of your development code will be built in the new `dev/builder/release/` folder. An Internet connection is necessary to run the builder, at least for the first time.

### Testing environment

Read more on how to set up the environment and execute tests in the [CKEditor 4 Testing Environment](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/dev_tests.html) guide.
