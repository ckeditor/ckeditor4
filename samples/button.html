				&quot;<b>Little Red Riding Hood</b>&quot; is a famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairy_tale"

				The version most widely known today is based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brothers_Grimm"
					title="Brothers Grimm">Brothers Grimm</a> variant. It is about a girl called
				Little Red Riding Hood, after the red <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hood_%28headgear%29"
					title="Hood (headgear)">hooded</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape" title="Cape">
						cape</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloak" title="Cloak">cloak</a>
				she wears. The girl walks through the woods to deliver food to her sick grandmother.</p>
			<p>
				A wolf wants to eat the girl but is afraid to do so in public. He approaches the
				girl, and she na&iuml;vely tells him where she is going. He suggests the girl pick
				some flowers, which she does. In the meantime, he goes to the grandmother&#39;s
				house and gains entry by pretending to be the girl. He swallows the grandmother
				whole, and waits for the girl, disguised as the grandmother.</p>
			<p>
				When the girl arrives, she notices he looks very strange to be her grandma. In most
				retellings, this eventually culminates with Little Red Riding Hood saying, &quot;My,
				what big teeth you have!&quot;<br />
				To which the wolf replies, &quot;The better to eat you with,&quot; and swallows
				her whole, too.</p>
			<p>
				A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter" title="Hunter">hunter</a>, however,
				comes to the rescue and cuts the wolf open. Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother
				emerge unharmed. They fill the wolf&#39;s body with heavy stones, which drown him
				when he falls into a well. Other versions of the story have had the grandmother
				shut in the closet instead of eaten, and some have Little Red Riding Hood saved
				by the hunter as the wolf advances on her rather than after she is eaten.</p>
			<p>
				The tale makes the clearest contrast between the safe world of the village and the
				dangers of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enchanted_forest" title="Enchanted forest">
					forest</a>, conventional antitheses that are essentially medieval, though no
				written versions are as old as that.</p>
