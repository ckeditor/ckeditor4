# Contributing to CKEditor

As CKEditor 4 has reached its end of life, the official development repository no longer accepts code contributions. Nonetheless, you can still make contributions through other means:

1. Create your own [plugins](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/plugin_sdk_sample.html) or [skins](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/skin_sdk_intro.html)
and submit them to [CKEditor Add-Ons Repository](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addons/plugins/).
2. Help localize CKEditor into your native language and update existing localizations by joining us at the
[CKEditor UI Translation Center](https://www.transifex.com/ckeditor/ckeditor/). Note - newly added translations will be only availabe in the LTS version of the editor.
3. Join StackOverflow and share your knowledge with [fellow CKEditor users and developers](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ckeditor).

**Your help will be much appreciated!**
