Code Snippet GeSHi Plugin
==================================================

The GeSHi plugin is no longer maintained. Due to the lack of ongoing support and updates, potential security vulnerabilities have been identified with its continued use. To mitigate these risks and enhance the overall security of the CKEditor 4, we have decided to completely remove the GeSHi plugin as a dependency. This change aims to maintain a secure environment and reduce the risk of any security incidents related to outdated or unsupported software.

For integrators who still require Code Snippet GeSHi syntax highlighter, we recommend adding the GeSHi library manually, with an understanding of the potential security vulnerabilities that may arise.

For installation and configuration instructions go to the [Code Snippet GeSHi documentation](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/features/codesnippetgeshi.html) in the [CKEditor Developer's Guide](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide.html).
