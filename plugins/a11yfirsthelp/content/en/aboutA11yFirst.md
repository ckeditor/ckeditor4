### What Is Accessibility?

* Information should be perceivable and usable by everyone, including people
with disabilities.

* Documents should be organized and structured to make them as easy to read
and understand as possible.

* Accessible documents are compatible with assistive technologies and
operating system accessibility features.

### People with disabilities include people who:

* cannot see very well or are blind;

* cannot hear very well or are deaf;

* have impaired motor skills or are paralyzed;

* have learning or cognitive disabilities that affect their ability to read
text or understand images.
