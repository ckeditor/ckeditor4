## Link

### Display Text

Providing accessible *Display Text* is straightforward if you keep the following guidelines in mind:

1. The *Display Text* for a link should describe the target of the link.

1. Do not use ambiguous text, such as “Click Here” or “More”.

1. Do not begin the *Display Text* with redundant words or phrases such as “Link” or “Link to”.

1. Be consistent: Links to the same URL or e-mail address should have the same *Display Text*.

1. In most cases, it is best not to use the link URL or e-mail address as the *Display Text*.

### About links

* Screen reader users often use the “List of Links” feature to identify and navigate to links on a page. When links are presented as a list,  using descriptive *Display Text* becomes even more important since understanding the target of each link no longer benefits from its original context within the document.

* Screen reader users often use the “Search” feature to find links on a page based on keywords they would expect to find in the *Display Text* of the links. Thus the more descriptive the link *Display Text*, the more effective the search feature will be in finding relevant links.

* Usable and accessible *Display Text* should be descriptive, unique and start with
keywords (NNG).

* The *Display Text* for links is like a sign post. It should tell you what
you’ll find when you follow it (NOMENSA).

### Why it's important

* Descriptive link text makes it easier for everyone to find and follow links
on a page that are of interest to them.

* Descriptive link text is especially important for people using screen
readers, who typically only hear the display text spoken to them through speech
synthesis and do not "see" the link in the context of other content on the page.

* When URLs, e-mail addresses or other ambiguous text are used as the display text for a link, it is impossible in many cases, and much more difficult in the remaining cases, for
screen reader users to find and follow links of interest to them.
