## Link

### How it works

* The *Display Text* for a link should be descriptive, unique and start with keywords (NNG).

* The *Display Text* must **not** be empty, since it results in the URL being used as the display text for the link.

* The *Display Text* must **not** use ambiguous text, for example "Click Here" or "More".

* The *Display Text* for links is like a sign post. It should tell you what you’ll find when you follow it (NOMENSA).

* Be consistent, the links to the same URL should have the same *Display Text*.

### Why it's important

* Descriptive link text makes it easier for everyone to find and follow links on a page that are of interest to them.

* It is especially important for people using screen readers who only hear the link text and do not "see" the link in the context of other content on the page.  So when URLs are used as *display text* or links the *display text* is ambiguous it is much harder for screen reader users to find and follow links of interest to them.
