Use the toolbar buttons shown above to:

* Insert/Remove Numbered List
* Insert/Remove Bulleted List
* Increase Indent
* Decrease Indent

### List properties via context menu

The context menu allows further configuration of list properties such as
numbering and bullet types by selecting:

* Numbered List Properties
* Bulleted List Properties

The context menu can be invoked by positioning the cursor in a list item and:

* right-clicking, using the mouse, or
* using Mouse Keys on Windows or Mac.

### About lists

* Use a numbered list when the order or sequence of the items is significant.
* Use a bulleted list when the order of the items is not significant.

### Why lists are important

* Lists convey grouping semantics for related items.
* Lists may also convey hierarchical structure.
* When related items are grouped as a list, information about the list is
  conveyed to screen reader users, including the type of list, the number of
  items it contains and the sequence number of the current list item.
