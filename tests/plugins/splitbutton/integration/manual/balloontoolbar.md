# Splitbutton and balloontoolbar integration test
## Expected behaviour to test:
1. Pressing arrow opens menu list with styles.
1. Buttons from list are working and change selected text style.
1. Style button before arrow is working.
1. Style button changes itself to match current selection active style.
1. When selected text has no style style button will change to default which is `Bold`.
1. Menu list active items are matching selected text style.
