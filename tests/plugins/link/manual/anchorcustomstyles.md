Play with the anchors.

Things to check:

* creating anchors,
* creating anchors with styled words,
* creating anchors with heavily styled content ( p>em>strong> etc.),
* creating anchors with different paragraph format,
* creating anchors with multiline words,
* modifying existing anchors.

Notes: 
* Testing multiline creating anchors should create anchors for each line. 
* Editing a few words with an existing anchor should replace it with one for the entire range.
