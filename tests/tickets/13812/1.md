This test won't work in IE8 and IE9, because these browsers don't support drag and drop.

## Scenario

1. Drop an image into the editable area.

### Expected result:

Uploading should start (indicated by a notification), then it should be aborted with an error ("File too big")
and notification - "Upload aborted by the user.".

There may appear a black, 10x10px square during the process, but it should disappear after aborting.

### Unexpected:

The black square remains after aborting.
