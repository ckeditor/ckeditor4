<!-- To reproduce this issue we need to put an editor in another iframe. Why is that? Bender automatically puts ckeditor.js file
before any configurable js file. By doing so it triggers initialization logic, e.g.
https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor-dev/blob/48311f85728398dd4b616b240292cffed6ec9d15/core/dom/element.js#L158. -->

<iframe src="_helpers/include.html" style="width:100%;height:800px"></iframe>
